# Economic model of the Second Terra :moneybag:

The Second Terra game has a double Token DAO economy system.

#### Terrano: :large_blue_circle:
It is the Decentralized Governance DAO Token, which is a Token with a stable value over time.

#### Liquidity:
The existing liquidity in the Terranos pool will be linked to an existing pancake pool to generate LP Token, converting these LP Tokens into liquidity to feed the liquidity of the Terrestrial Peso.

Each Terrano is generated by adding liquidity to the pool and is burned by taking liquidity out of the pool.
